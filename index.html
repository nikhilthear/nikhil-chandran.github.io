            <p>
                I help B2B companies and trade show exhibitors turn messy contact lists into clean, responsive data that gets results ‚Äî without buying overpriced lists or falling into the "lead volume" trap.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the past few years, I‚Äôve worked with global teams across IT, healthcare, retail, and manufacturing to support 30+ campaigns for events like HIMSS, AACC, and KBIS. From building pre-show visibility to post-show follow-ups, I run high-integrity, manual outreach campaigns that your sales team can trust.
