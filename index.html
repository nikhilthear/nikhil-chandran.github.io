  <h2 class="section-title">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
  <div class="faq-q">Q1: How is your service different from automated email campaigns?</div>
  <div class="faq-a">We manually send and manage every email and follow-up, ensuring each message feels personal and natural. This increases open and reply rates, helps avoid spam filters, and builds trust. Automation lacks this touch, leading to lower engagement.</div>

  <div class="faq-a">
    • Email open rates of 30%–50% (vs. 15%–25% industry average)<br>

    • Meeting bookings of 2%–5% of contacts reached<br>

    • Faster post-show lead conversion through timely follow-ups
  </div>

  <div class="faq-q">Q3: How soon before the trade show should I start the campaign?</div>
  <div class="faq-a">We recommend starting your pre-show outreach 2–3 months in advance. This builds awareness, schedules meetings, and generates buzz.</div>

  <div class="faq-q">Q4: What kind of data do you use for the email campaigns?</div>
  <div class="faq-a">We provide a clean, verified, bounce-free contact database tailored to your industry and target audience. Post-campaign, the full list is yours for reuse.</div>

  <div class="faq-q">Q5: Do you handle post-show follow-ups?</div>
  <div class="faq-a">Yes! We offer manual email campaigns with up to 3 follow-ups per lead to convert booth visitors into customers.</div>

  <div class="faq-q">Q6: What if I don’t have much time or staff to manage marketing?</div>
  <div class="faq-a">No worries — we handle all outreach logistics. Your team focuses on the show while we manage email campaigns, lead tracking, and reports.</div>

  <div class="faq-q">Q7: Can you help me book meetings before the show?</div>
  <div class="faq-a">Absolutely. We can integrate booking tools like Calendly to make it easy for prospects to schedule demos or visits in advance.</div>

  <div class="faq-q">Q8: How do you measure campaign success?</div>
